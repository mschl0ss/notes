# Doing the litter
Needs to be done every 2-3 days.  I have an app that will tell me if it's totally full, but the bags are not quite literally a dime a dozen so if you empty it out before it's 100% full that's perfectly fine and probably for the best.

4. press the power button to turn it back on
	- it should auto cycle, if not press the cycle button
5. do a little sweep up (trash can is right there)
