# Doing the litter
Needs to be done every 2-3 days.  I have an app that will tell me if it's totally full, but the bags are not quite literally a dime a dozen so if you empty it out before it's 100% full that's perfectly fine and probably for the best.

2. take out the liner bag with gross litter

4. pour in new litter up to litter fill line
	- just kinda pour some in and eyeball the pile, if there's extra it's not the end of the world 
4. press the power button to turn it back on
	- it should auto cycle, if not press the cycle button
5. do a little sweep up (trash can is right there)
6. the litter bag goes in the orange Home Depot bucket with the blue Natick trash bag in it
