# Barley Food
1.5 scoops in the morning, 1.5 scoops in the evening.

***He's taller than he looks nothing on the counter is safe!!*** 

I generally just Google things he's eaten to make sure they're safe. Onions are at least as deadly as chocolate, otherwise nothing sticks out.

# Taking him out

He'll need to go out pretty quickly in the morning, but he takes his sweet as time doing his business.

We have the beep collar, easier to show in person how to do that.

Leash by the door.

Poop bags in the pantry.

# At night

These days he generally prefers his own crate upstairs for sleeping, it's fine to close the door on him overnight. If you want a very nice cuddle in the morning you can call him to the bed when you wake up.
