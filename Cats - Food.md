There are 4 types of cat sustenance
- Water - ideally will get refreshed once
- Wet food - every morning
- Dry food - always
- Snackies - whenever

Every morning, clean out their wet/food snack bowls, refresh their water, and top off their dry food.

# Water
We got them a cat fountain thingy. Just make sure there's water in it and if it's gross change out the water and give it a rinse. There's nothing complicated really to the device, just change it out over the sink because it can unexpectedly spill. 

One time I changed the water and put it back and the water was somehow not coming out and I didn't notice for a while. The cats were non plussed.

# Wet Food
They get this every morning.  Take one of the Purina tins out of the pantry and split it between the two wet food/snack bowls.

# Dry Food
They should always have this available. Just about a pinkies width layer of food in the bowl.

# Snackies
Whenever they're suspiciously gathering around their food bowls and meowing. About 5-10? each is a normal serving.  Like more than 3 but not a whole meal.
