There are 4 types of cat sustenance
- Water - ideally will get refreshed once
- Wet food - every morning
- Dry food - always
- Snackies - whenever

Every morning, clean out their wet/food snack bowls, refresh their water, and top off their dry food.

# Water
We got them a cat fountain thingy. It's in the dining room. Just make sure there's water in it and if it's gross change out the water and give it a rinse. There's nothing complicated really to the device, just change it out over the sink because it can unexpectedly spill. 

One time I changed the water and put it back and the water was somehow not coming out and I didn't notice for a while. The cats were non plussed.

# Wet Food
They get this every morning.  Take one of the Blue Wilderness tins out of the pantry and split it between the two wet food/snack bowls. They *will* get in your way and meow at you. It *will* piss you right off after it stops being cute.

# Dry Food
They should always have this available. Just about a pinkies width layer of food in the bowl.  *Not too much!* When they eat this a bunch gets back in the bowl and then they don't want it, and probably Otis will puke in it as a protest to not having fresh food. If it's totally empty when you get home at night or in the morning, then fine do a little more.

# Snackies
Whenever they're suspiciously gathering around their food bowls and meowing. About 10-15? each is a normal serving.  Like more than 3 but not a whole meal.
